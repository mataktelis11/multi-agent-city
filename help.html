    <h1>Multi agent city traversal</h1>
        
    <p>In this website we run a simulation of agents doing tasks in a city. The city is a 2d grid and contains obstacles and goals. Each agent needs to visit all the goals in the grid in order and then go back to its starting position. It's important to note that the agents don't know the layout of the map initial, so they have to fist explore it to find where the goals are.</p>
    
    <p>Once an agent finds all the goals in the map, it will plan it's path and proceed to follow it.</p>
    
    <p>Each agent has a limited amount of energy, and it's decreased by one each time it takes a step. To compensate for this, there are energy pots on the grid which the agents can collect and use to replenish some energy.</p>
    
    <p>Also there is gold on the ground which can be collected by the agents and used.</p>
    
    <p>To run the simulation simply click "load default map" on the right and then click "start simulation" on the top.</p>
